# Chain-Replication-Spec
A specification of the [Chain Replication protocol](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/rvr/papers/OSDI04.pdf) for storage services written in TLA+ (incomplete).

This project was created for Robbert van Renesse's CS 6480: Systems and Formal Methods class in the Spring 2020 semseter. The original goal was to specify the entire chain replication protocol, but because of the COVID-19 epidemic the semester was disrupted and the project was left unfinished. This is a specification of the client interface to the protocol; I had originally wanted to specify the protocol itself as well and show that the client interface was a refinement of the protcol.
